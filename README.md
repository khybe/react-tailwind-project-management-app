# Project Management App (React & Tailwind)

## Overview

This Project Management App allows users to create, manage, and delete projects and tasks. It features responsive design, interactive task management, and state management using `useReducer` and `useContext`.

## Features

- **Project & Task Management**: Users can add, delete, and manage tasks and projects.
- **Responsive Sidebar**: A sidebar with project listings that adapts to smaller screens using Tailwind CSS.
- **State Persistence**: Project data is saved using `localStorage`.
- **Centralized State Management**: Managed with `useReducer` and `useContext` to avoid prop drilling.

## Technologies Used

- **React** (with Hooks: `useReducer`, `useContext`, `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `forwardRef`, `useImperativeHandle`)
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design
- **HTML** for the DOM structure
- **localStorage** for data persistence
